hey there, we're team AT&Team.

our app is as yet unnamed... probably going to go with trail
blazrrr or a greek god name.  obvi.

our MVP consists of a google maps page where one can search
for places or drop pins and then write descriptions.

release 2 involves the users and such.

more info to be transcribed from vanessa's notebook soon.
